I created an employee tracker in which I used node.js, CMS, database, inquirer and MYSQL. The use types in node index.js to start the app. The user is then prompted to chose from options on a list. If the user chooses to view a database will be shown with relevent information. The user is also able to add new employees and roles as well as update departments.
